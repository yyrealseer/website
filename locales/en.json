			"q2": "Are there any file format restrictions for song stems?",
			"a2": "Generally, any WAV file is acceptable. It is recommended that the material specifications meet or exceed the default product specifications (16 bit/44.1 kHz). If below this specification, the final product will match the material. Suggested material format is 24 bit/48 kHz.",
			"q3": "Can I specify the product specifications?",
			"a3": "To meet the specifications required for streaming platforms, the default product specifications are MP3 (192 kbit/s), WAV (16 bit/44.1 kHz). If higher formats (such as 24 bit/48kHz) are needed, please notify in advance, and the material must meet the specified specifications.",
			"q4": "Why does a typical studio charge over US$1,000 per track, but you only charge US$155 per track? Are there quality concerns?",
			"a4": "Currently, mixing entities are divided into 'recording studios' and 'music studios,' mainly differentiated by hardware equipment levels. 'Hardware equipment' and 'production quality' are not necessarily directly related. YY Studio falls under the 'music studio' category. Although we do not have the hardware quality of a recording studio, the production quality is sufficient for independent music tracks. However, if you are pursuing high hardware quality and have a sufficient budget, a recording studio would be a better choice."

		},
